<popupText>Store more in less</popupText>
<longText>You decided that the Wand of the Adept won't be enough for the magic you are trying to do. You have formulated a theory for a more advanced wand that can hold a fair bit more vis.</longText>
<page type = "text">After learning more about the Aura through direct inspection of it using the Goggles of Revealing, you decided you need a better wand, thus, you formulated a wand perfect for an experienced Tinkerer.

ThThis wand can carry 500 vis, unlike the Wand of the Adept. It's not a very dispendious item either. The downside of being forced to store more vis, although, is that it recharges slower in comparison to it's counterpart, the Wand of the Adept.</page>
