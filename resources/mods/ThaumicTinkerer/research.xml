<name>Wand of the Tinkerer</name>
<popupText>[TT] Store more in less</popupText>
<longText>You decided that the Wand of the Adept won't be enough for the magic you are trying to do. You have formulated a theory for a more advanced wand that can hold a fair bit more vis.</longText>
<page type = "text">After learning more about the Aura through direct inspection of it using the Goggles of Revealing, you decided you need a better wand, thus, you formulated a wand perfect for an experienced Tinkerer.

This wand can carry 500 vis, unlike the Wand of the Adept. It's not a very dispendious item either. The downside of being forced to store more vis, is that it recharges slower in comparison to it's counterpart, the Wand of the Adept.</page>

Right clicking on one block will encase it into the wand. Right clicking with a block in the wand will move it elsewhere.

This power is provenient from the portable hole, so your new wand will be able to get anything the portable hole can.</page>

<longText>Researching The Aura is becoming important. You seem to have figured out a way to directly conjure vis from the aura into matter.</longText>
<page type = "text">After researching further into the intricacies of the Aura itself, you have found out a way to directly siphon it's vis, and using aspects from nearby aspectual sources, conjure it into matter.

This block can accept an item to be used as a pattern to create a new one. Only simple items, in terms of aspect count can be created, and in doing so, it takes both vis from the aura, and the quadruple of each aspect from that item.</page>

<page type = "text">After knowing that Zombie Brains have the ability to store experience, you have created a talisman that mimics that behaviour, not to a perfect extent though.

To switch the ability to store experience, you need to shift-right-click on the talisman. When the talisman is enabled, it'll absorb any nearby experience orbs, those can be transformed back into useable experience by right clicking with a glass bottle in your inventory, turning that bottle into a Bottle o' Enchanting.</page>
